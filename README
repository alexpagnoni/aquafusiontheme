DESCRIPTION

Aqua Fusion is an extensive and elaborated icon theme designed for KDE. It
contains icons in the "Aqua" style for devices, filesystems, mimetypes,
actions and applications in all standard sizes from 16x16 up to 64x64.
Future expansions to this theme are planned.

This fusion between "Aqua" and Linux was made possible through a
collaboration between Daniel Flax (design & artwork) and Markus Mueller
(adaptation & preparation). We are proud of what we have been able to
achieve during the last several weeks, especially considering that fact that
we are both located on different continents. We hope you enjoy this theme as
much as we did creating it.

The whole package is released under the "Design Science Licence" which is
approved by the FSF as "free and copyleft license meant for artistic works"
and conforms roughly to the GPL.

Any suggestions, comments and opinions are highly appreciated. Dan will
be glad to answer any question regarding the artwork itself while Markus
will patiently try to solve any technical problems.
